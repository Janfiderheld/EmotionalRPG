		<E1_Frage Text="Have you heard!? The rebels have taken our main outpost on Camino! The whole 501st squadron is dead!">
			<E1_AntwortTrauer Text="Oh no, that was the squadron of HD-4514, wasn’t it!? Damn, we were together in basic training…">
				<E1_ReaktionTrauer Text="Oh sorry, I didn’t know that you knew people from that squadron…"/>
			</E1_AntwortTrauer>
			<E1_AntwortAngst Text="Damn, I am going to Camino next week for my first outdoor operation. I didn’t realize how contested this planet is.">
				<E1_ReaktionAngst Text="Don’t worry, you’ll be fine! I think you’re going to the other side of the planet."/>
			</E1_AntwortAngst>
			<E1_AntwortWut Text="Damn this rebel scum! I’m going to make them pay for what they have done!">
				<E1_ReaktionWut Text="Well, what do you expect!? We’re at war!"/>

		<E2_Frage Text="You know PT-7531? I saw him in a huge fight with our commander on my way here. I think he was in trouble for the broken blaster. Remember, the one that AH-4850 broke last week?">
			<E2_AntwortWut Text="This is so unfair! We need to stand up for him and tell the commander what really happened.">
				<E2_ReaktionWut Text="I had the same idea! Let’s talk with the captain as soon as you finish your repairs."/>
			</E2_AntwortWut>
			<E2_AntwortTrauer Text="The poor guy! He does not deserve this, we should help him!">
				<E2_ReaktionTrauer Text="I had the same idea! Let’s talk with the captain as soon as you finish your repairs."/>
			</E2_AntwortTrauer>
			<E2_AntwortAngst Text="Oh yeah, but AH-4850 is such a bully. I don’t want any trouble.">
				<E2_ReaktionAngst Text="Oh okay, I thought you would care about him. I’m a bit surprised…"/>
			</E2_AntwortAngst>
			<E2_AntwortNeutral Text="Honestly, I don’t care what happens to him. He can stand up for himself.">
				<E2_ReaktionNeutral Text="Oh okay, I thought you would care about him. I’m a bit surprised…"/>

		<E3_Frage Text="Well, whatever… Did I mention that I finally met someone?">
			<E3_Rueckfrage Text="Oh, do I know her?"/>
			<E3_AntwortRueckfrage Text="I don’t suppose you know HIM. His name is Tatchinga and he is a Wookiee from Kashyyyk."/>
			<E3_AntwortFreude Text="I’m really happy for you, you deserve to be happy!">
				<E3_ReaktionFreude Text="Thank you, your appreciation really means a lot to me!"/>

		<E4_Frage Text="Anyways, the main reason why I came here: Are you making progress with that engine? The commander needs you!">
			<E4_AntwortFreude Text="I am nearly finished! Give me twenty more minutes and I’ll be there.">
				<E4_ReaktionFreude Text="Very good! Don’t make the commander wait."/>
			</E4_AntwortFreude>
			<E4_AntwortWut Text="This piece of galactic garbage is completely broken! I need at least the rest of the day to finish this.">
				<E4_ReaktionWut Text="How disappointing. But the commander needs to see you, you can continue repairing after that."/>
			</E4_AntwortWut>
			<E4_AntwortAngst Text="Oh no, I am not finished but I can’t disappoint the commander…I am coming right with you!">
				<E4_ReaktionAngst Text="Don’t worry, he won’t kill you."/>
			</E4_AntwortAngst>
			<E4_AntwortNeutral Text="Yeah, could be worse. I need about two hours until I’m finished.">

		<E5_Frage Text="Oh man, AH-4850 is such a bad guy! This morning at breakfast, he bragged about sleeping with one of the new slave girls who arrived last week. Can you imagine!?">
			<E5_AntwortVerachtung Text="What kind of person would do such a thing!? He needs to be punished!">
				<E5_ReaktionVerachtung Text="I am totally on your side, we should bring it up when we talk with our commander."/>

			<E5_AntwortEkel Text="That is so disgusting, she had no possible chance to get away from him! That poor thing…">

			</E5_AntwortEkel>
			<E5_AntwortWut Text="I could kill him right now! We need to get him what he deserves!">
				<E5_ReaktionWut Text="Wow, I understand you, but killing him isn’t the right way. We need to talk to our commander."/>
			</E5_AntwortWut>
			<E5_AntwortNeutral Text="I don’t care what happens to the slaves.">

		<E6_Frage Text="Hey, uhm, I never talked to anyone about this, but I’m thinking about leaving the empire. Joining the rebels. I am sick of the people we have to work with! We’re supporting a fucking dictatorship!">
			<E6_AntwortFreude Text="I feel exactly the same! I never thought someone else would share my doubts. ST2, believe me, I want to come with when you leave!">
				<E6_ReaktionFreude Text="That’s great! I hoped for that reaction of you. It’s a bit spontaneous, but let’s leave with that TIE-Fighter, once you finish the repairs."/>
			</E6_AntwortFreude>
			<E6_AntwortUeberraschung Text="Wow, I would have never guessed you could think about that!? You were always this supportive for our cause!? I can’t let you leave!">
				<E6_ReaktionUeberraschung Text="Oh, I had hoped you would be more understanding. I’m sorry my friend."/>

		<Ende1_BothFlee Text="After you finish the repairs, you and TM-1337 get into the TIE-Fighter and use your knowledge about the guard shifts on your ship to use the best moment to escape into the endless freedom of the universe. As you travel through the galaxy to find a place where you can join the rebellion, your bond grows deeper and deeper until you find them, months after you deserted. You made it. You left the empire behind. And now you’re on your way to your first mission as part of the rebel forces. You are sent to a small forest moon called Endor…"/>
		
		<Ende2_Fight Text="Exactly at the moment, he stops talking, TM-1337 reaches for his gun and you reach for yours.  Both of you are fast and for a small moment, you see the regret in his eyes. You see that he wanted you to join him, but you won’t. You are happy with your life as it is, you don’t need the trouble of being a rebel. As you pull the trigger you realize that he was faster, but he missed. You always knew he was a bad gunman, but for the first time you’re happy for it. You survive but your good friend is dead. Is it really worth it?"/>
		
		<Ende3_ST2Leaves Text="TM-1337 turns around and leaves. You feel sad to see him leave, knowing that you will never see him again. But at the same time, you are happy for him as he finally found his destiny. You turn around with a smile and continue your work. On the next day at lunch, you overhear two radio technicians  talking about a Stormtrooper who stole a TIE-Fighter and was able to shake off the ships that were chasing him . He made it!"/>
		
		<Ende4_CommanderAlone Text="After you finish your work, you go to your commander. Alone. As you meet with him, he seems pretty happy with your work over the past few months. As he talks about your good work, you start to remember how TM-1337 was always there to help you, if you had any questions. He is a true friend. As you start to listen again, you realize that your commander is offering you a promotion. Should you take it?"/>
		
		<Ende5_CommanderTogether Text="You stop working and walk to TM-1337. Both of you leave the room and go to your commander. He talks about your work and that you need to step up your game or you would get suspended! After your boss leaves, … is there for you to comfort you. He is a really good friend."/>
		
		<Ende6_Wookiee Text="After you made that distasteful joke, TM-1337 just leaves. He never was the type who liked your special kind of humour. As you continue working you ask yourself why he visited you in the first place…ENTERYou should soon find out, as your commander storms in the room, shouting about an appointment you missed and how you ignored him! The fact that you aren’t finished with the engine only fuels his rage and he suspends you."/>
